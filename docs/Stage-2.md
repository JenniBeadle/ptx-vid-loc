- **Prep**: 
   -  Record a short video on making a correction. 
      -  For example, in English video:
      -  Change an occurrence of **odhe** to **ohde**. Use Wordlist tool. 
      -  **RECORD**!!!! Mark ohde as incorrect and select odhe as the corrected spelling. Use this recording briefly in the edited Camtasia project.
- Transition to show saved details: 
  - Make a separate recording of the wordlist tool, open menu, select ‘show reviewed words that are no longer exist in project’. 
  - Search for _hdaali_.  
- (1:51) It needs errors have been previously made (see above about a recording).

This tool uses corrections that have already been made before which are then used to identify other corrections. To get Paratext to remember corrections they must be made in the wordlist (not manual corrections).

## Biblical terms
To learn the process of identifying Biblical terms, it helps if the viewer can at least vaguely understand the translation. Therefore the English videos use a back translation (into an European language) as the actual translation project. But it needs to be clear that translators use their **vernacular** language project and identify Biblical terms in their vernacular translation **not** their back translation.
