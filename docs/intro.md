### How to use this site
This site is a work in progress. It is being developed to help you localise the Paratext videos. The videos are grouped by stages. 

|  Stage  | Code |  # of videos |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [**0-Introduction**](Trans/Introduction.md) | (0.x) | 28 videos |
| [**Stage 1**](Trans/Stage-1.md) | (1.x - 1A.x) | 27 videos |
| [**Stage 2**](Trans/Stage-2.md) | (2.x) | 17 videos]
| [**Stage 3**](Trans/Stage-3.md) | (3.x)  |  17 videos |
| [**Stages 4-6**](Trans/Stage-4-6) | (4.x, 5.x, 6.x) | 6 videos |
| [**Admin**](Admin/Admin.md) | | videos |


For each video, it describes
- resources available, links to **Overview pdf** pdf **Actions srt** files. 
- notes on any preparation needed on the project 
- any screenshots, pdfs, websites, etc
- notes on any potential problems

### Projects
Choosing a suitable project is important. 
- A local language is preferable, one that is recognisable/vaguely understandable by the teams if at all possible
- make sure you have copyright permission to use it
- you will need other projects for specific videos (e.g. mixed capitalisation, interlinearisation)

If you do not have a suitable local project, sample projects are available for you to use. You can either restore one of these backups or copy the MTT4 project folder.
- Paratext backups of a number of projects are available on the Google Drive in the [**resource folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HjqFRWwj8jsI6ykPW5Fx4_oMjuRBafWO). These need to be restored and registered.

- If you want to use MTT4, then several copies of the [MTT4 project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eITkJ2HiBh1-rHx2Ton4Aa4jYbOrXJ9b) are available at various saved with examples prepared. 
:::caution
These folders are copies of the contents of  **MTT4** folder in **My Paratext 8 Projects** folder. To use them you copy the contents to the folder in your My Paratext 8 Projects folder. Please **do not** send/receive - copy and paste the folders instead.

### Project plans
Several videos require complex project plans. That is, tasks assigned but waiting for other tasks. To make it easier, copies of the ProjectProgress files can be found at [**Project plans folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B5L--2h7hH5bch3lC-eh6UjgID0iwLdZ?usp=sharing). The [**README**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcNOxeTBOnlCqzNy4Q2zpqcaBLT3Usg5dtWzTisJMiE/edit?usp=sharing) file has some instructions/suggestions for use.
