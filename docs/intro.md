This site has been developed to help you localise the Paratext videos. Notes for the videos are grouped by stages. 

- [**Introduction**](Introduction.md) (0.x)
- [**Stage 1**](Stage-1.md) (1.x - 1A.x)
- [**Stage 2**](Stage-2.md) (2.x)
- [**Stage 3**](Stage-3.md) (3.x)
- [**Stages 4-6**](Stage-4-6) (4.x, 5.x, 6.x)

For each video, it describes
- the resources available
- advice on the choice of project for each video
- notes on any preparation needed on the project 
- any screenshots, pdfs etc
- notes on any potential problems

### Projects
Choosing a suitable project is important. A local language is preferable. If you do not have a suitable local project, sample projects available for you to use. You can either restore one of these backups or copy the MTT4 project folder.
- Paratext backups of a number of projects are available on the Google Drive in the [**resource folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HjqFRWwj8jsI6ykPW5Fx4_oMjuRBafWO). These need to be restored and registered.

- Copies of the [MTT4 project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eITkJ2HiBh1-rHx2Ton4Aa4jYbOrXJ9b) are also available at various saved with examples prepared. 
:::caution
These folders are copies of the contents of  **MTT4** folder in **My Paratext 8 Projects** folder. To use them you copy the contents to the folder in your My Paratext 8 Projects folder. Please **do not** send/receive. Copy and paste the folders instead.

### Project plans
Several videos require complex project plans. See [**Project plans folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B5L--2h7hH5bch3lC-eh6UjgID0iwLdZ?usp=sharing). The [**README**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcNOxeTBOnlCqzNy4Q2zpqcaBLT3Usg5dtWzTisJMiE/edit?usp=sharing) file has some instructions/suuggestions for use.
