## Choose a good project
- one that is recognisable/vaguely understandable by the teams if at all possible
- make sure you have copyright permission to use it
- will need other projects for specific videos (e.g. mixed capitalisation, interlinearisation)

## Files
For each video there is at least:
- **Overview** = link to the 2-3 page PDF on GoogleDrive
- **Actions** = link to the actions.srt file (optional)
- **Opening Screen**
- followed by any additional hints on what is needed for producing the video particularly in preparing the project (see below).

## Prepare the project for the video
Some projects need either
- specific examples
- addition of mistakes to correct
- addition of users
- setup tasks/assignments to project plan
- inventories ...
