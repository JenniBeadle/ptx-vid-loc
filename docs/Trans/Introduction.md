- **Opening screen**  Any passage in standard view
- **Prep**: 
  - You can use **any project** for this video.
  - You need to decide which language to start with.  
    -  Since Paratext asks you to choose the interface language on installation, your viewers may already be in your language. So it may be better to start in your language and then change to English.

- **Opening screen**  Mat 1
- **Prep**: 
-   First part 
    - Show a **Good** arrangement of
    - Mat 1:  Windows open: project, several resources (tabs and pane), biblical terms renderings.
    - two items in Autohide (e.g. dictionary)
    - one floating window (? Greek text)
  - Second part
    - Start with **Messy** arrangement of windows
    - 5 windows in columns  
  Project, dictionary, two resources, notes list

Notes from script:
- Open five or six windows, the PTP and multiple resources. Have one of each type of Window display. (Include NRSV, HBKENG)
Avoid opening an enhanced resource, as the line between the text and the research pane may look confusingly like the border between projects when arranging panels.  

:::caution
Susanna failed to record the screen actions in a way which worked with this script so she ended up having to change the script. The order of teaching planned here is probably superior though, so if a localizer can achieve it like this, all the better!
